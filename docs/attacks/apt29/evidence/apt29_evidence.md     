# APT29 Investigation Evidence (Splunk)

This document summarizes the confirmed evidence of an APT29-style attack
observed and investigated as part of the AWS Cloud Security Project.

---

## Attack Overview

- **Threat Actor:** APT29 (Cozy Bear) – simulated
- **Affected Host:** ip-10-0-0-149 (Web Server)
- **Log Source:** nginx:access:apt29
- **Total Events:** 15

---

## Attack Time Window

- **Start Time:** 12/31/2025 07:25:43
- **End Time:** 12/31/2025 07:35:24
- **Duration:** ~9.7 minutes

The short, focused duration is consistent with stealthy APT behavior
rather than noisy commodity attacks.

---

## Evidence Collected

### 1. Web Access Anomalies

- Multiple HTTP requests from limited source IPs
- Repeated access to suspicious or uncommon URI paths
- Activity clustered tightly in time

These indicators suggest reconnaissance or exploitation attempts.

---

### 2. Behavioral Indicators

- Low event volume
- No random scanning across long periods
- Concentrated activity window

This pattern aligns with advanced threat tradecraft rather than brute-force attacks.
